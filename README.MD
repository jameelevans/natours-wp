# Natours Wordpress Theme

This project shows examples of advanced usage of CSS and SASS. This Wordpress theme features navigation and popups animations made of pure CSS. In this project I utilize many examples of the lesser-known CSS declarations that helps create next generation websites, with feature queries for browers that are behind on the innovation curve.
